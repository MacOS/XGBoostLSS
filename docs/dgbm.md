# Introduction

The development of modelling approaches that approximate and describe the data generating processes underlying the observed data in as much detail as possible is a guiding principle in both statistics and machine learning. We therefore strongly agree with the statement of Hothorn et al. (2014) that *''the ultimate goal of any regression analysis is to obtain information about the entire conditional distribution $F_{Y}(y|\mathbf{x})$ of a response given a set of explanatory variables''*. It has not been too long, though, that most regression models focused on estimating the conditional mean $\mathbb{E}(Y|\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x})$ only, implicitly treating higher moments of the conditional distribution $F_{Y}(y|\mathbf{x})$ as fixed nuisance parameters. As such, models that minimize an $\ell_{2}$-type loss for the conditional mean are not able to fully exploit the information contained in the data, since this is equivalent to assuming a Normal distribution with constant variance. In real world situations, however, the data generating process is usually less well behaved, exhibiting characteristics such as heteroskedasticity, varying degrees of skewness and kurtosis or intermittent and sporadic behaviour. In recent years, however, there has been a clear shift in both academic and corporate research toward modelling the entire conditional distribution. This change in attention is most evident in the recent M5 forecasting competition  (Makridakis et al., 2022a,b), which differed from previous ones in that it consisted of two parallel competitions: in addition to providing accurate point forecasts, participants were also asked to forecast nine different quantiles to approximate the distribution of future sales.

# Distributional Gradient Boosting Machines

This section introduces the general idea of distributional modelling. For a more thorough introduction, we refer the interested reader to Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005); Klein et al. (2015a,b); Stasinopoulos et al. (2017).

## GAMLSS

Probabilistic forecasts are predictions in the form of a probability distribution, rather than a single point estimate only. In this context, the introduction of Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) by Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005) has stimulated a lot of research and culminated in a new research branch that focuses on modelling the entire conditional distribution in dependence of covariates. 

### Univariate Targets

In its original formulation, GAMLSS assume a univariate response to follow a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ that depends on up to four parameters, i.e., $y_{i} \stackrel{ind}{\sim} \mathcal{D}(\mu_{i}, \sigma^{2}_{i}, \nu_{i}, \tau_{i}), i=1,\ldots,n$, where $\mu_{i}$ and $\sigma^{2}_{i}$ are often location and scale parameters, respectively, while $\nu_{i}$ and $\tau_{i}$ correspond to shape parameters such as skewness and kurtosis. Hence, the framework allows to model not only the mean (or location) but all parameters as functions of explanatory variables. It is important to note that distributional modelling implies that observations are independent, but not necessarily identical realizations $y \stackrel{ind}{\sim} \mathcal{D}\big(\mathbf{\theta}(\mathbf{x})\big)$, since all distributional parameters $\mathbf{\theta}(\mathbf{x})$ are related to and allowed to change with covariates. In contrast to Generalized Linear (GLM) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM), the assumption of the response distribution belonging to an exponential family is relaxed in GAMLSS and replaced by a more general class of distributions, including highly skewed and/or kurtotic continuous, discrete and mixed discrete, as well as zero-inflated distributions. While the original formulation of GAMLSS in Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005) suggests that any distribution can be described by location, scale and shape parameters, it is not necessarily true that the observed data distribution can actually be characterized by all of these parameters. Hence, we follow Klein et al. (2015b) and use the term distributional modelling and GAMLSS interchangeably.

From a frequentist point of view, distributional modelling can be formulated as follows

\begin{empheq}[left=y_{i} \stackrel{ind}{\sim} \mathcal{D} \empheqbiglparen, right=\empheqbigrparen]{align}
	h_{1}(\theta_{i1}) &= \eta_{i1} \\ 
	h_{2}(\theta_{i2}) &= \eta_{i2}  \\ 
	\vdots \\                        
	h_{K}(\theta_{iK}) &= \eta_{iK} 
\end{empheq}

for $i = 1, \ldots, n$, where $\mathcal{D}$ denotes a parametric distribution for the response $\textbf{y} = (y_{1}, \ldots, y_{n})^{\prime}$ that depends on $K$ distributional parameters $\theta_{k}$, $k = 1, \ldots, K$, and with $h_{k}(\cdot)$ denoting a known function relating distributional parameters to predictors $\eta_{k}$. In its most generic form, the predictor $\eta_{k}$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\eta_{k} = f_{k}(\mathbf{x}), \qquad k = 1, \ldots, K 
\end{equation} 

Within the original distributional regression framework, the functions $f_{k}(\cdot)$ usually represent a combination of linear and GAM-type predictors, which allows to estimate linear effects or categorical variables, as well as highly non-linear and spatial effects using a Spline-based basis function approach. The predictor specification $\eta_{k}$ is generic enough to use tree-based models as well, which allows us to extend  XGBoost to a probabilistic framework.

### Multivariate Targets

To allow for a more flexible framework that explicitly models the dependencies of a $D$-dimensional response $\mathbf{y} = (y_{i1}, \ldots, y_{iD})^{T}, i=1, \ldots, N$, Klein et al. (2015) introduce a multivariate version of distributional regression. Similar to the univariate case, multivariate distributional regression relates all $\theta_{k}$, $k = 1, \ldots, K$ parameters of a multivariate density $f_{i}\big(y_{i1}, \ldots, y_{iD} | \theta_{i1}(\mathbf{x}\big), \ldots, \theta_{iK}(\mathbf{x})\big)$ to a set of covariates $\mathbf{x}$. A common choice for multivariate probabilistic regression is to assume a multivariate Gaussian distribution, with the density given 

\begin{equation}
	f\big(\mathbf{y}|\theta_{\mathbf{x}}\big) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{D}|\Sigma_{\mathbf{x}}|}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{y} - \mu_{\mathbf{x}})^{T} \Sigma^{-1}_{\mathbf{x}} (\mathbf{y} - \mu_{\mathbf{x}})\right)
\end{equation}

where $\mu_{\mathbf{x}} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ represents a vector of conditional means, $\Sigma_{\mathbf{x}}$ is a positive definite symmetric $D \times D$ covariance matrix and $|\cdot|$ denotes the determinant. For the bivariate case $D=2$, $\Sigma_{\mathbf{x}}$ can be expressed as 

\begin{equation}
	\Sigma_{i\mathbf{x}} = \begin{bmatrix}
		\sigma^{2}_{i,1}(\mathbf{x}) & \rho_{i}(\mathbf{x})\sigma_{i,1}(\mathbf{x})\sigma_{i,2}(\mathbf{x})  \\
		\rho_{i}(\mathbf{x})\sigma_{i,2}(\mathbf{x})\sigma_{i,1}(\mathbf{x}) & \sigma^{2}_{i,2}(\mathbf{x})  \\
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

with the variances on the diagonal and the covariances on the off-diagonal, for $ i=1, \ldots, N $. Other examples include the Cholesky Decomposition or a Low-Rank Covariance approximation of the covariance matrix. For additional details and available distributions, see MÃ¤rz (2022).

### Normalizing Flows

The principle that underlies Normalizing Flows is to turn a simple base distribution, e.g., $F_{Z}(\mathbf{z}) = N(0,1)$, into a more complex and realistic distribution of the target variable $F_{Y}(\mathbf{y})$ by applying several bijective transformations $h_{j}$, $j = 1, \ldots, J$ to the variable of the base distribution 

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{y} = h_{J} \circ h_{J-1} \circ \cdots \circ h_{1}(\mathbf{z})
\end{equation}

Based on the complete transformation function $h=h_{J}\circ\ldots\circ h_{1}$, the density of $\mathbf{y}$ is then given by the change of variables theorem

\begin{equation}
	f_{Y}(\mathbf{y}) = f_{Z}\big(h(\mathbf{y})\big) \cdot \Bigg|\frac{\partial h(\mathbf{y})}{\partial \mathbf{y}}\Bigg| \end{equation}

where scaling with the Jacobian determinant $|h^{\prime}(\mathbf{y})| = |\partial h(\mathbf{y}) / \partial \mathbf{y}|$ ensures $f_{Y}(\mathbf{y})$ to be a proper density integrating to one.

## GBMLSS: Gradient Boosting Machines for Location, Scale and Shape
We draw inspiration from GAMLSS and label our models as XGBoost for Location, Scale and Shape (XGBoostLSS). Despite its nominal reference to GAMLSS, our framework is designed in such a way to accommodate the modeling of a wide range of parametrizable distributions that go beyond location, scale and shape. XGBoostLSS requires the specification of a suitable distribution from which Gradients and Hessians are derived. These represent the partial first and second order derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to the parameter of interest. GBMLSS are based on multi-parameter optimization, where a separate tree is grown for each parameter. Estimation of Gradients and Hessians, as well as the evaluation of the loss function is done simultaneously for all parameters. Gradients and Hessians are derived using PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities. The flexibility offered by automatic differentiation allows users to easily implement novel or customized parametric distributions for which Gradients and Hessians are difficult to derive analytically. It also facilitates the usage of Normalizing Flows, or to add additional constraints to the loss function. To improve the convergence and stability of GBMLSS estimation, unconditional Maximum Likelihood estimates of the parameters are used as offset values. To enable a deeper understanding of the data generating process, GBMLSS also provide attribute importance and partial dependence plots using the Shapley-Value approach.
