class Gaussian:
    """
    Gaussian distribution class.

    Distributional Parameters
    -------------------------
    loc: torch.Tensor
        Mean of the distribution (often referred to as mu).
    scale: torch.Tensor
        Standard deviation of the distribution (often referred to as sigma).

    Source

    Parameters
    -------------------------
    stabilization: str
        Stabilization method for the Gradient and Hessian. Options are "None", "MAD", "L2".
    response_fn: str
        When a custom objective and metric are provided, XGBoost doesn't know its response and link function. Hence,
        the user is responsible for specifying the transformations. Options are "exp" or "softplus".
    loss_fn: str
        Loss function. Options are "nll" (negative log-likelihood) or "crps" (continuous ranked probability score).
        Note that if "crps" is used, the Hessian is set to 1, as the current CRPS version is not twice differentiable.
        Hence, using the CRPS disregards any variation in the curvature of the loss function.
